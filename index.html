    Welcome to your very own web‑based escape room!  Throughout the game you'll
    be asked to explore different parts of your browser — including the page's
    source, the Developer Tools and the Network tab.  Each stage reveals a
    secret needed to unlock the next.  Pay attention to every element on
    screen and don't be afraid to inspect what's hidden beneath the surface.

  <div id="container">
    <!-- Stage 1 -->
    <section id="stage1" class="stage">
      <h1>Escape the Webpage</h1>
      <p>
        You find yourself trapped inside this digital maze. Your only hope is
        to solve the puzzles hidden within the page. The first key to your
        freedom is a four‑digit code — it's hidden somewhere in this
        document. Search the source (hint: look at the HTML comments) and
        enter the code to proceed.
      </p>
      <input id="codeInput" type="text" maxlength="4" placeholder="Enter the 4‑digit code">
      <button id="codeSubmit">Submit</button>
      <!-- secretCode: 5318 -->
    </section>

    <!-- Stage 2 -->
    <section id="stage2" class="stage hidden">
      <h2>Stage&nbsp;2: Hidden Text</h2>
      <p>
        Great! You've unlocked the second challenge. Somewhere on this
        page is a hidden word. Try highlighting the blank area below or
        examining the CSS to reveal it. Once you've found the word,
        type it into the box and continue.
      </p>
      <div id="hiddenMessage" class="hidden-message">REVEAL</div>
      <input id="wordInput" type="text" placeholder="Hidden word">
      <button id="wordSubmit">Submit</button>
    </section>

    <!-- Stage 3 -->
    <section id="stage3" class="stage hidden">
      <h2>Stage&nbsp;3: Console Magic</h2>
      <p>
        You're halfway there! For this challenge you will need to open
        your browser's Developer Tools. Use <kbd>F12</kbd> or
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (or
        <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on macOS) to bring up
        the console. Then type <code>escapeNext()</code> and hit
        <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This will advance you to the final puzzle.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Stage 4 -->
    <section id="stage4" class="stage hidden">
      <h2>Stage&nbsp;4: The Final Key</h2>
      <p>
        One last hurdle stands between you and freedom. When you ran
        <code>escapeNext()</code> a hidden network request was made.
        Open the <em>Network</em> tab in your Developer Tools and find the
        file called <code>clue.txt</code>. Inside is a four‑letter key.
        Type the key into the box below and click&nbsp;Unlock.
      </p>
      <input id="finalInput" type="text" maxlength="4" placeholder="Enter final key">
      <button id="finalSubmit">Unlock</button>
    </section>

    <!-- Victory screen -->
    <section id="victory" class="stage hidden">
      <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
      <p>You have successfully escaped the webpage. Well done!</p>
